# TODO ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) the structure will probably be similar to that of the other two models, with a few caveats perhaps
#   - the datamodules should somehow find a way to merge the datasets used for the two models by themselves;
#       do not want to create an actual additional dataset with additional preprocessing
#   - anything else?
